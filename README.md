# Data-Visualization-with-Power-BI

In this Power BI report, I assumed as a business intelligence analyst for Waggle, a startup that makes smart devices for pets. Recently, Waggle has been thrilled by the success of their new Lapdog device, **a fitness collar that lets owners track their dog’s steps, alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas! Reviews have been fantastic, sales are growing, and—best of all—the product really works!**

The CEO of Waggle is pushing for a feline version as a result of this achievement, although there are doubts about its practicality. In order to conduct field testing, the product team gave away 1,000 Lapcat prototypes. Here I am going to provide a boardroom-ready Power BI report that compares the Lapcat data to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices after months of data collection. This report will be presented to the CEO since it will either help him or her decide whether Lapcat is the next big thing or an expensive error that should be avoided.

**Business Requests:**

- The CEO is curious about the following questions:
  1. Did the average daily steps increase for cats wearing the device as they did for dogs?
  2. Were owners of Lapcat devices as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?
- The Chief Marketing Officer would like the report to be “on-brand” by including only colors from the Waggle color palette, the Waggle logo, and other approved company logos and icons.
- The product team wants me to incorporate other visuals and insights as I see fit but is most interested in demographic comparisons between the dogs and cats using Waggle devices as well as any information about the families who own the pets. They would also like slicers to help them filter and explore on their own.

This and many other insights will be discovered in this Power BI report
